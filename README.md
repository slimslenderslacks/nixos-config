# NixOS System Configurations

> [!NOTE]
> Mitchell Hashimoto's original justification.

This repository contains my NixOS system configurations. This repository
isn't meant to be a turnkey solution to copying my setup or learning Nix,
so I want to apologize to anyone trying to look for something "easy". I've
tried to use very simple Nix practices wherever possible, but if you wish
to copy from this, you'll have to learn the basics of Nix, NixOS, etc.

I don't claim to be an expert at Nix or NixOS, so there are certainly
improvements that could be made! Feel free to suggest them, but please don't
be offended if I don't integrate them, I value having my config work over
having it be optimal.

## Setup (VM)

## Setup (macOS/Darwin)

To utilize the Mac setup, first install Nix using some Nix installer.
There are two great installers right now:
[nix-installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)
by Determinate Systems and [Flox](https://floxdev.com/). The point of both
for my configs is just to get the `nix` CLI with flake support installed.

Once installed, clone this repo and run `make`. If there are any errors,
follow the error message (some folders may need permissions changed,
some files may need to be deleted). That's it.

## Setup (WSL)

**THIS IS OPTIONAL** I recommend you ignore
this unless you're interested in using Nix to manage your WSL
(Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment, too.

I use Nix to build a WSL root tarball for Windows. I then have my entire
Nix environment on Windows in WSL too, which I use to for example run
Neovim amongst other things. My general workflow is that I only modify
my WSL environment outside of WSL, rebuild my root filesystem, and
recreate the WSL distribution each time there are system changes. My system
changes are rare enough that this is not annoying at all.

To create a WSL root tarball, you must be running on a Linux machine
that is able to build `x86_64` binaries (either directly or cross-compiling).
My `aarch64` VMs are all properly configured to cross-compile to `x86_64`
so if you're using my NixOS configurations you're already good to go.

Run `make wsl`. This will take some time but will ultimately output
a tarball in `./result/tarball`. Copy that to your Windows machine.
Once it is copied over, run the following steps on Windows:

```
$ wsl --import nixos .\nixos .\path\to\tarball.tar.gz
...

$ wsl -d nixos
...

# Optionally, make it the default
$ wsl -s nixos
```

After the `wsl -d` command, you should be dropped into the Nix environment.
_Voila!_
